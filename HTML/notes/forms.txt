forms are used to collect inputs into webpages from users. 
eg: signin , signup, feedback, suggestion, application,
contact,appraisal form etc..,

   The complete form uses 'form' tag. it contains attributes
like 
  action: contains path to where input details will be submitted

Inputs will be collected using 'input' tag. it is a self closing tag. it contains attributes like
  type: used to define type of input
  placeholder: dummy text placed in input until user inputs a value. used for hints
  value: used to have a value for input by default
