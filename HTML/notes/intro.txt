HTML(Hypertext Markup Language):

     web developemant started with GML(generalised Markup Language),later it developed as SGML(standard generalised Markup Language)
     and finally in 1992,web starts HTML(Hypertext Markup Language).
     HTML is used to provide struture/skeleton of the website.It provides all the text,media,forems button etc..,
     the current version of HTMLis HTML5.
To work with HTML,we need a code editer.download and install VScode
  step 1:goto https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  step 2: download 'windows' setup and .exe file will be download
  step 3: double click on download file and next-->next until install-->finish

  Everything in HTMLis developedby tags.we can have open tag and close tag
  <tagname>   ---open tag
  </tagname>  ---close tag

  Whole HTML will be inside <html> and </html>
  html contains 2 elements head and body
  head contains meta data(data about the data)
  head also contains titel
  body contains actual content of the website

  <html>
   <head>
     <title>my first web site</title> 
   </head>
   <body>
    HELLO world
   </body>
</html>
VScode provides some shortcuts called "emmets"
!+enter or html:5+enter will give basic template of HTML

In HTML, we can mention comments between <!--   and -->. comments are used for better readability of code
